This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The function `combine` is intended to concatenate two arrays of numbers. However, if either `arr1` or `arr2` is actually an array of strings, the function will produce a type error.  The solution demonstrates how to use type guards to check the types of the input arrays and provide more robust type checking.
